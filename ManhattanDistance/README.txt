The purpose of this script is to give all the possible paths between two coordinates on a chess board, travelling only horizontally and vertically.  This is done by randomly generating sequences of vertical and horizontal moves until all are found - the total number is known via the combination formula.  This was done early in my programming career and is a slow, brute-force approach (recursion, dynamic programming etc. would be much faster).
