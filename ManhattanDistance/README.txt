The purpose of this script is to give all the possible paths (travelling only vertically and horizontally) between two coordinates on a chess board.  This is done by randomly generating sequences of vertical and horizontal moves until all are found (the total number is mathematically known).  This was done early in my programming career and is a very slow approach (most inputs run in under a minute, but going from one corner of the board to the other can take multiple hours – solutions that remember what valid paths have already been generated would obviously be much faster).  Nonetheless, I think it’s a good showcase of putting together a lot of moving parts.
